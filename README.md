This is a Python code for the purpose of analyzing Cyber Patrol traffic in the Dark Web (Tor Network). Traffic analysis (machine learning) 
can be used to identify access sites. It calculates the similarity between the teacher data and the training data and uses the values to 
identify and deanonymize the client's access site. The Dark Web is a highly anonymous Internet that allows access to the Internet under
privacy protection. However, since cyber crimes have been committed by abusing this anonymity, police and other authorities sometimes 
analyze traffic (fingerprinting attacks) to disable anonymity and identify the access sites of dark web users. In addition, members of congress 
and government officials also use the Dark Web for legitimate duties purposes, and malicious hacker against them intent to invade their privacy 
also analyze traffic to identify access sites.
