The Dark Web is an anonymous Internet that allows users to access the Internet under privacy protection. However, cyber 
crimes also occur that exploit that anonymity, so police and others analyze traffic (fingerprinting) to disable anonymity 
and identify the sites accessed by Dark Web users. In addition, there are also lawmakers, government officials, and others 
who use the Dark Web for legitimate purposes, and those with malicious intent to invade their privacy also try to identify 
access sites by analyzing traffic. Traffic analysis Python code for the Dark Web (Tor Network). Traffic analysis is used 
to help users identify access sites.
